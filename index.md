**Name:** Sanjai Subramanian

**About me:** I'm a lackluster programmer who is feeling kind of overwhelmed by all the stuff we have to do for this lab.
Even with this very helpful [Github tutorial](https://github.com/bzdgn/git-tutorial) I still feel mostly lost.

My favorite three programming languages, in order, are:

1. Python
2. Java
3. C

Coincidentally, these are also basically the only 3 languages I know with any degree of real skill.

As a person, I have a few hobbies:

- Reading fiction (mainly fantasy)
- Playing games (both board and video)
- That's basically it
- In case you've yet to figure it out by now, I'm not a very nuanced human being

My main goals for this class are:

- [ ] Learn how to work with other people
- [ ] Learn how git works, like at all, because it makes no sense to me
- [ ] Obtain a passing grade in a remotely instructed class centered around teamwork and social interaction

So apparently I'm supposed to include a bunch of different Markdown elements, most of which don't feel like they organically belong in an About page, so I guess I'll just do them inorganically.

In case you forgot where the beginning of this document is and your scroll wheel is broken, it's right [here](https://github.com/s8subram/CSE-110-Lab-1/blob/main/index.md#about).

Here's a [link](README.md) to the README.md document of this repo, I guess.

So I only recently learned that you're supposed to use `git log` to obtain your commit history, rather than just keeping it all in your brain.
